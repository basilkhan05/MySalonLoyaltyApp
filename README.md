# MySalonLoyaltyApp
A prototype for replacement of Loyalty Punch cards with basic customer tracking options. This tool was built using PHP with mySQL database. 
The tool also use the Google Maps API to track the users on a map based on their postal code upon signup.

Giving out physical coupon or punch cards makes it hard for any business to manage and track. This tool hopes to minimize some of the challenges faced with a very basic and minimum functionality  online web tool.

Note: this is only a prototype and thus no login pages and detailed analytics have been implemented.
